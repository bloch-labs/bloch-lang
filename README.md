# Bloch

Bloch is a modern, open-source programming language for quantum software.

This repository contains the current development version of the Bloch language and compiler.

> **Status:** Bloch is under active pre-1.0 development. Language syntax, compiler interfaces,
> package formats and internal representations may change between releases.

## Development

Bloch requires:

- a C++20-compatible compiler
- CMake 3.28 or later
- Ninja

Configure the development build:

```bash
cmake --preset dev
```

Build:

```bash
cmake --build --preset dev
```

Test:

## Project history

Bloch was originally developed in the
[`bloch-labs/bloch-legacy`](https://github.com/bloch-labs/bloch-legacy)
repository.

The original implementation was published in the *Journal of Open Source Software* in 2026.
